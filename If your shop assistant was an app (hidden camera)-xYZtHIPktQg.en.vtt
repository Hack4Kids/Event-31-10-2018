00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.720
- That looks good.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.340
- I'd like to see the last five text messages you've sent.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
- Excuse me?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.800
- My phone number? Then I want yours too.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.360
- No way. No, I refuse.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720
- I sent a text to my sister.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.960
- And what's her number?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.460
- I can't give you her number. Certainly not!

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.360
- I can't do that without her permission.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.560
- Where were you at 8 p.m. yesterday?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.560
- I was at my parents' house.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.733
- Can I have their number?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.100
- No.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.720
- Hi. I'm coming with you to see where you're going.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.640
- What? Okay. This is a bit strange.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.460
- We're going that way.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340
- Okay. Fine.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.880
- That will be 13 kroner. And your phone number, please.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.820
- Why?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.540
- That's standard. So we can provide a better service.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.160
- I'd rather not.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.740
- Then your e-mail address?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.220
- No, just give me my roll.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.320
- Where were you at 8 p.m. yesterday?
